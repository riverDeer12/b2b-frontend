Regional digital innovation platform for the transfer of knowledge between academic communities and the economy in the Primorje-Gorski Kotar County and beyond with the aim of developing the innovation ecosystem in the region.

The platform enables the networking of economic entities, entrepreneurs, researchers, scientists, the public and non-governmental sector and other interested participants with the aim of transferring knowledge based on the results of research and development activities.

The platform encourages multidirectional interaction and proactive networking to connect development projects and needs of the economic and public sector with research and innovation solutions, achievements, competences and potentials of the scientific sector.

The platform enables the mapping of the needs of the economy and the public sector in the field of development and implementation of advanced digital technologies with the potential to create products and services with more added value through a multidisciplinary approach combining resources, infrastructure, knowledge, competences, and the availability of human capital in the region.

Idea of this project and repository is to refactor frontend of existing RIMAP platform ([rimap.uniri.hr](https://rimap.uniri.hr)).
Mostly in part of user's administration and in manner to prepare frontend for better future updates.
